# ES Extended v2 Docs

***ESX v2 is still under the development, it is not reccomended you
use this in production***

TODO: Will rephrase this to be less gimmicky and more introductory

ES Extended v2 is the next iteration of ESX. Built from the ground up practically all aspects of the
framework have changed in how they perform, operate, and interact.

We recommend you take a look at some of the larger architectural changes listed below

**Architecture Changes from v1**

- A single core resource
- A module system
- The addition of some OOP elements


**Additional Features**

- Database auto migration
- Additional table, string, and math utilities

> **Warning:**
